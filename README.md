# titanic_survival
Houses all code used to predict survival on the Titanic (introductory problem from Kaggle).

The code housed in this repository reflects a foray into ensemble methods using the Titanic data. There is some preprocessing performed on the data prior to feeding it into the model, but my primary purpose was to explore how stacking could be used to improve prediction.
